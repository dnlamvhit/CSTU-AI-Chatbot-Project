# CSTU-AI-Chatbot-Project
This is a capstone project by Lam Ngoc Dao for MSCSE at CSTU - 2024 
The capstone project integrates the knowledge and skills learned from the courses taken during the program of Master of Sccience in Computer System and Engineering at California Science and technology University. This project is implemented to develop a GenAI-based chatbot for the California Science and Technology University (CSTU) by tailoring a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model with the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method which combines the strengths of both retrieval-based and generative models, offering a versatile approach to conversational Artificial Intelligent (AI). The chatbot provides students, faculty, and staff with an interaction that is both efficient and responsive, simplifying access to information and automating tasks such as course registration and grade inquiries. By leveraging technologies like GPT, RAG, and vector embedding database, the chatbot seeks to improve user experience and streamline routine processes.
Scope
•	Defining Use Cases:
This initial phase involves identifying the specific functionalities the chatbot will offer to users. These functionalities should address user needs and align with the overall purpose of the chatbot. 
•	Technical Design and Implementation:
This phase focuses on building the core functionality of the chatbot system. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:
-	Data Preparation: Collect and clean relevant textual data that the chatbot will utilize to respond to user queries. Techniques like normalization, tokenization, and cleaning are often employed to ensure data quality.
-	Large Language Model Selection: Choose an LLM suitable for the project's needs.  
-	System Architecture Design: Define the overall system structure. 
-	Knowledge Base Building: Store relevant data and its corresponding embedding vectors for efficient retrieval.  
-	Embedding Model Selection/Training: Choose a pre-trained embedding model or train a custom model on specific data corpus to convert text into embedding vectors.
-	Chatbot Development: Build the user interface for interaction and implement functionalities to process user queries, retrieve information, formulate prompts to guide the LLM, and display the generated responses.

•	Testing and Evaluation:
This phase ensures the chatbot functions as intended and delivers a positive user experience:
-	Testing: Conduct thorough testing with diverse user queries to assess the chatbot's ability to handle various scenarios and identify potential issues.
-	Evaluation: Evaluate the chatbot's performance using relevant metrics such as response accuracy, handling of ambiguity, fluency, and user satisfaction.
•	Deployment and Maintenance (Optional):
This involves deploying the chatbot in a production environment for user access and ongoing maintenance:
-	Deploy the chatbot system to a suitable platform for user interaction (e.g., website integration).
-	Continuously monitor the chatbot's performance and user feedback. Update the knowledge base with new information as needed. Consider updating knowledge-base and retraining the model over time.
